This is my second  post.

A digital ecosystem is a distributed, adaptive, open socio-technical system with properties of self-organisation, scalability and sustainability inspired from natural ecosystems. Digital ecosystem models are informed by knowledge of natural ecosystems, especially for aspects related to competition and collaboration among diverse entities.[1][2][3][4] The term is used in the computer industry,[5] the entertainment industry,[6] and the World Economic Forum.[7]
